LinkLens – Smart Clusters Implementation Cheatsheet

1. Project Snapshot

LinkLens is a privacy‑first bookmarking platform that enriches saved URLs with AI‑powered metadata and surfacing tools.

Current Foundation

Authentication & Capture: Secure login plus manual and browser‑extension link saving.

Metadata Pipeline: Title, favicon, full‑page content, and GPT‑generated descriptions.

Organization Layer: Nested folders, tags, and bulk actions.

Search & Discovery: Instant full‑text search, rich filters (date, domain, tag), and sorting.

Intelligent Utilities: Duplicate detection and early AI summaries.

Strategic Inflection Point: Ship Smart Clusters as the signature AI feature for a compelling MVP.

2. MVP Checklist (Launch‑Critical)

Core Smart‑Cluster Engine

Automatic clustering via OpenAI embeddings + pgvector.

Concept bridges → short “why these links connect” insights.

Cluster summaries (1‑2 sentences) auto‑generated.

Weekly email digests of new patterns.

User‑Friendly Cluster Controls

Essential (always visible)

Slider: # of clusters (auto‑detect default).

Rename, merge (drag‑and‑drop), move links.

“Why this cluster?” info popover.

Advanced (progressive disclosure)

Grouping sensitivity (Loose ⇄ Strict).

Update frequency (Real‑time / Daily).

Scope (All vs. Recent links).

MVP Foundation

Freemium tiering – e.g., 50‑100 links free.

Interactive onboarding tour showcasing Smart Clusters with sample data.

Inline feedback (“Was this insight helpful?”) for model tuning.

3. UX & Interaction Playbook for Smart Clusters

Design Question

Recommended Pattern

Display location

Hybrid: Embedded accordion sections in main library plus a dedicated “Cluster Analysis” page (canvas view).

Folder parity

Behave like folders but carry an AI badge & gradient background; extra controls gated behind hover/advanced panel.

Creation trigger

Auto‑create when ≥10 links saved in 24 h; manual Recluster button in toolbar.

Link deletion

Re‑compute insight; disband if cluster <3 links. Toast "Cluster updated" with Undo.

Drag‑and‑drop

Pre‑drop color cue (green/orange/red by similarity). Regenerate insight if similarity ≥ 70 %. Suggest new cluster if low match.

User messaging

Dismissible confidence (%), “Why this group?” modal, blue‑dot indicators for new activity—avoid modal spam.

4. Recommended UX Flow (Happy Path)

Save links ➜ Auto cluster (background job).

Sidebar shows new AI section with expandable Smart Clusters.

User hovers → sees AI badge + quick actions.

Click opens Cluster Analysis canvas (semantic map + list).

Interact: drag links, rename clusters, tweak sensitivity.

Weekly digest email recaps emerging themes and bridges.

5. Open Follow‑Up

Which early‑adopter persona (researcher, curator, developer, etc.) will you optimize the Smart Cluster workflow for first? Tailoring copy and default settings to that audience can sharpen initial product‑market fit.

Keep this sheet handy during dev sprints to stay laser‑focused on the MVP’s differentiating value.
