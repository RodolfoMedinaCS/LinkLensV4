2. Detailed Explanation of Each Component
User Interface (apps/web)

    Tech: TypeScript + Next.js

    Structure Example:

apps/web/
├── components/         # React/Next UI components (LinkCard, ClusterList, etc.)
├── pages/              # Next.js routes
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks for fetching/auth logic
├── lib/                # API clients, Supabase client setup
├── styles/             # CSS or Tailwind
├── public/             # Static assets
├── utils/              # Helper functions
└── ...

Role: Handles all user interaction. Talks to Supabase directly for data and auth.






AI Engine (apps/ai-engine)

    Tech: Python + FastAPI (sometimes with background tasks or celery workers)

    Structure Example:

apps/ai-engine/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py         # FastAPI entry point
│   ├── api/            # REST endpoints (if needed)
│   ├── tasks/          # Background jobs (scraping, clustering)
│   ├── db/             # DB client (supabase-py or httpx REST calls)
│   └── utils/          # AI, clustering, scraping utils
├── requirements.txt
└── ...

Role: Does heavy/slow processing outside the frontend. Reads/writes to Supabase via API or direct client.






Supabase (supabase/)

    Tech: Supabase CLI, SQL, YAML for RLS policies, etc.

    Structure Example:

    supabase/
    ├── migrations/         # DB schema changes (SQL)
    ├── seed/               # Example seed data
    ├── functions/          # Edge functions (JS/TS)
    ├── types/              # DB types (auto-generated)
    ├── storage/            # File storage rules
    └── ...

    Role: Provides DB, Auth, storage, and (optionally) edge/serverless functions.







3. How Everything Talks

    Frontend (Next.js): Calls Supabase via supabase-js for all CRUD/auth.

    AI Engine (FastAPI): Polls Supabase for new data, runs jobs, updates DB via supabase-py or REST.

    Supabase: Stores all data, manages auth, and provides APIs.






4. Monorepo Tools (Optional but Recommended)

For projects with both frontend and backend, consider:

    Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, or Yarn workspaces
    These make it easier to share code and manage dependencies.






5. Summary Table
Layer	Tech Stack	Folder	Role
User Interface	Next.js + TS	apps/web/	UI, Auth, fetches from Supabase
AI Engine	FastAPI + Python	apps/ai-engine/	AI, background tasks, writes to Supabase
Data & Services	Supabase	supabase/	DB, Auth, Storage, instant API

LinkLens – MVP Scope & Road-map

(Professional Product Brief)
1. Minimum Viable Product (Launch Focus)
Pillar	AI-Powered Capability	Why It Differentiates LinkLens Today
One-Click Capture	Browser extension scrapes rich metadata (title, author, tags, images) the moment a link is saved.	Removes manual entry friction; data quality is consistent from day 1.
Smart Summaries	LLM generates a concise 2–3 sentence synopsis for every link.	Users can triage content at a glance—rarely offered in bookmark tools.
Semantic Search	Vector search lets users ask natural-language queries (“design-system case studies”).	Surfaces relevant links regardless of exact keywords.
Auto-Clustering	After 10+ links, LinkLens groups them by topic and displays a confidence score.	Eliminates early-stage “folder fatigue” and showcases AI value instantly.
Quality Control	Duplicate and dead-link detection runs continuously.	Keeps collections clean without user intervention.

Goal: Deliver these five features in a polished web app + extension so the product already feels AI-first before any collaboration layer is added.
2. Deferred Functionality (Post-MVP)
Phase	Feature	Rationale for Deferral
Phase 2	Shared folders & workspaces (invite teammates, role-based permissions).	Collaboration adds product-market breadth; core AI experience must shine first.
Phase 2	Real-time co-editing and link comments.	Builds on folder sharing once stable user flows are proven.
Phase 3	Team analytics (engagement metrics, trend dashboards).	Requires critical mass of shared data to be meaningful.
Phase 3	Weekly digest emails & recommendations.	Enhances retention after foundational behaviors are established.
3. MVP Success Criteria
Metric	Target at 90 Days Post-Launch
Active users saving ≥25 links	500+
Average links auto-clustered	80 % of total links
Monthly duplicate/dead-link alerts resolved	>70 %
User satisfaction (in-app NPS)	≥45
4. One-Sentence Positioning

    LinkLens launches as the AI-native bookmark manager that automatically summarizes, clusters, and quality-checks your saved links—collaboration features will follow once the solo experience is best-in-class.
