LinkLens – MVP Scope & Road-map

(Professional Product Brief)
1. Minimum Viable Product (Launch Focus)
Pillar	AI-Powered Capability	Why It Differentiates LinkLens Today
One-Click Capture	Browser extension scrapes rich metadata (title, author, tags, images) the moment a link is saved.	Removes manual entry friction; data quality is consistent from day 1.
Smart Summaries	LLM generates a concise 2–3 sentence synopsis for every link.	Users can triage content at a glance—rarely offered in bookmark tools.
Semantic Search	Vector search lets users ask natural-language queries (“design-system case studies”).	Surfaces relevant links regardless of exact keywords.
Auto-Clustering	After 10+ links, LinkLens groups them by topic and displays a confidence score.	Eliminates early-stage “folder fatigue” and showcases AI value instantly.
Quality Control	Duplicate and dead-link detection runs continuously.	Keeps collections clean without user intervention.

Goal: Deliver these five features in a polished web app + extension so the product already feels AI-first before any collaboration layer is added.
2. Deferred Functionality (Post-MVP)
Phase	Feature	Rationale for Deferral
Phase 2	Shared folders & workspaces (invite teammates, role-based permissions).	Collaboration adds product-market breadth; core AI experience must shine first.
Phase 2	Real-time co-editing and link comments.	Builds on folder sharing once stable user flows are proven.
Phase 3	Team analytics (engagement metrics, trend dashboards).	Requires critical mass of shared data to be meaningful.
Phase 3	Weekly digest emails & recommendations.	Enhances retention after foundational behaviors are established.
3. MVP Success Criteria
Metric	Target at 90 Days Post-Launch
Active users saving ≥25 links	500+
Average links auto-clustered	80 % of total links
Monthly duplicate/dead-link alerts resolved	>70 %
User satisfaction (in-app NPS)	≥45
4. One-Sentence Positioning

    LinkLens launches as the AI-native bookmark manager that automatically summarizes, clusters, and quality-checks your saved links—collaboration features will follow once the solo experience is best-in-class.
